Here the steps to install GO

STEP 1:- visit golang.org/dl

     -> now select the version you want, 32bit or 64bit and also the type of 
     operating system like WINDOWS,MAC,LINUX and dowanload it


STEP 2:- now install the downladed file of go
	
	-> now the most important i want you to know is that to check whether
	  you downloaded the correct file and make sure there is no man in 
	  the middle or you didnt download a virus file 

	-> so to chech that you have to run a command shaw

STEP 3:- open bash and cd to documents
STEP 4:- type command openssl shaw -shaw256 <filename>
	
	-> <filename> is the go file name you downloaded previously 
	   now after you hit enter the command you'll get a checksum

	-> check it with the one on the webpage you downloaded the go from 
	   and it if its exact same you downloaded the exact file which 
	   is inteded to download
	
	-> now that its downloaded ckeck if it works

STEP 5:- open bash and type go env
	
	-> if you see the go variables it means that it works
	-> you can run go version and help commands to check the version 
	   and help to check the help tools.
