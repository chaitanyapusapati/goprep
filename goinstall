Here Are The Steps To Install GO

STEP 1:- Visit golang.org/dl

     -> Select the version you want 32bit or 64bit, also the type of 
     operating system like WINDOWS or MAC or LINUX and download it


STEP 2:- Now install the downladed file of go
	
	-> Now the most important thing I want you to know is that, To check whether
	  you downloaded the correct file or not and make sure there is no man in 
	  the middle or you didnt download a virus file 

	-> So to check that, you have to run a command "shaw"

STEP 3:- Open bash and goto documents folder using cd command.
STEP 4:- Type command "openssl shaw -shaw256 <Filename>"

	-> <Filename> is the go file name you downloaded previously 
	   now after you hit enter the command, you'll get a checksum

	-> Check it with the one on the webpage you downloaded the go from 
	   and it if it is exact, you downloaded the correct file which 
	   you intended to download
	
	-> Now that its downloaded check whether it works or not

STEP 5:- Open bash and type "go env"
	
	-> if you see the go variables it means that it works
	-> you can run "go version" and "help" commands to check the version 
	   and to check the help tools.
